## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Building a console-based programme to automate the manual RAILWAY RESERVATION SYSTEM.
## FEATURES:
1. This is a console-based programme which simulates Railway Reservation System.
2. It enables the admin to securely login into the admin’s window to add and remove trains. 
3. It allows users to create their accounts on the platform to book or cancel tickets or check status of their tickets.
4. Users can enter their choices and details to get desired outcomes.
5. Appropriate output is generated according to the user’s input.
## DATA STRUCTURES USED:
 ### 1. SINGLY LINKED LIST:
      List of all trains
      List of removed trains
      List of passengers with confirmed tickets for a particular train
      List of all bookings made by a user
      List of all user accounts and their credential
#### Size of these lists is dynamic, hence singly linked  list is used for efficient insertion and deletion.
### 2. QUEUE
      Waiting list of passengers for a particular train
#### Queue is used to implement First in First Out mechanism for waiting passengers. 
### 3. ARRAY
      List of seats in a particular train
#### Array of boolean values is used to check whether a particular seat in a train is vacant or not. Its size is static and provides efficient searching.
## LEARNINGS AND OUTCOMES:
1. Importance and application of Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and Flowcharts
2. Application and implementation of various linear data structures
3. Importance of static keyword (used a static variable to keep track of booking ID)
4. Learned a new concept of Regular Expressions
5. Learned a powerful tool - GitHub
## WHAT'S NEXT:
1. User interface for better user experience.
2. Database for storing train and station data.
